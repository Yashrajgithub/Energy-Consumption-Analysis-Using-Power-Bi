# ⚡ Energy Consumption Analysis Using Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data using **Microsoft Power BI** to derive actionable insights for better decision-making. It involves importing datasets, performing data cleaning and transformation, building interactive dashboards, and identifying trends in energy usage.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize energy consumption patterns across various parameters (time, location, source, etc.).
- Identify peak usage hours and seasonal trends.
- Compare renewable vs non-renewable energy sources.
- Generate insights to support sustainability goals and energy efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV Data**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query Editor**

## 📁 Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project includes:

- Timestamps of energy usage
- Energy consumption values (kWh)
- Location/region
- Type of energy source (Renewable/Non-renewable)

## 📈 Features & Insights

- **Interactive Dashboards**: Slice and filter energy data by year, region, and source type.
- **Trend Analysis**: Visual line charts showing energy consumption trends over time.
- **Pie Charts & Bar Graphs**: Breakdown of renewable vs non-renewable energy usage.
- **KPIs**: Total consumption, average daily usage, and % change over months.
